# fencing

A little reporting website for fencing that:
* calculates the number of victories
* calculates the given score
* calculates the received score
* calculates the ratio
* validates the table and warns the user about victories on both side or missing victory
* and ranking

Currently it is only in Hungarian and has no validation. 

I am planning to 
* add login with Facebook and Google.
* add saving possibilities
* possibility of changing the victory score
* add a victory with different score
* download report matrix as a jpeg
